Rules for Creating Viral Content: Insights from “The Writing Framework”
1. Start with the End in Mind:
2. Define the emotion you want to evoke (e.g., curiosity, outrage, inspiration).
3. Decide the action you want the audience to take (e.g., share, subscribe, purchase).
4. Ensure there's a memorable takeaway—one clear sentence or idea the reader will remember.
5. Prioritize Persuasion and Clarity
6. Use writing as a scalable tool for persuasion, whether it's selling, storytelling, or influencing decisions.
7. Writing reveals and sharpens your thinking. Clear writing comes from clear thinking, and the act of writing can generate new ideas.
8. Focus on Emotional Triggers. Use Emotion to Drive Engagement
9. Viral content relies on emotional resonance. 
10. Use emotions like: 
- LOL: Humor or joy or  light-hearted observations.
- WTF: Shock or outrage or counterintuitive insights
- OMG: Awe or surprise or Awe-inspiring milestones or achievements.
- Aww: Heartwarming or tender moments or Personal, heartwarming stories
- Work backward from the emotion you want to evoke. Build your content to amplify this feeling. Tailor your posts to evoke strong emotions, which encourages sharing and discussion.
11. Leverage Storytelling. Use Storytelling Techniques. Ensure every story has a clear arc with a satisfying resolution.
12. Follow the “intention and obstacle” framework:
- Intention: What does the character want?
- Obstacle: What's standing in their way?
- Resolution: How was it overcome?
13. Use stakes to create tension. Even small stakes can feel significant if emotionally framed.
14. Write Like You Talk
15. Informal, conversational writing is engaging and relatable.
16. Test this by explaining your idea out loud—if it sounds awkward, rethink the phrasing.
17. Avoid jargon and overly formal language. Use accessible, straightforward words.
18. Don't Bury the Lead
19. Start with a punchy, attention-grabbing statement or question.
20. Provide the most provocative or essential information upfront to hook readers immediately.
21. Mind the “curiosity gap”: share just enough to pique interest and keep readers engaged.
22. Master the Hook.  Leverage Scroll-Stopping Hooks
23. Focus on the first 3 lines (200 characters). Make it curiosity-driven or provocative to ensure “See More” is clicked.
24. Examples of hooks:
- “I failed 3 startups before discovering this one secret.”
- “9 TED Talks in 9 days that changed my life.”
- “Want to achieve more in less time? Here's how.”
- “This took me 10 years to learn—I'll teach you in 2 minutes.”
- “Want to save 30% on your next AI project? Here's how.”
- “Why 98% of people fail at building successful startups.”
25. Write Simply and Concisely: Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level. 
26. Use short sentences to improve readability and impact.
27. Create Rhythmic Writing
- Aim for a flow that feels musical. Use a mix of sentence lengths and rhetorical devices like repetition, contrast, and internal dialogue.
- Engage the Reader's Internal Dialogue. Address their unspoken questions or thoughts directly in your writing (e.g., 'You're probably wondering…').
- Vary sentence lengths for rhythm—alternate between short, medium, and occasional long sentences for emphasis.
28. Ruthlessly refine and polish. Cut out fluff, reorganize, and clarify ideas.
29. Think Beyond Clickbait: It's not clickbait if you deliver on your promise.
30. Use sensational headlines but ensure the content meets or exceeds expectations.
31. Avoid Spam-like Behavior. No poor spelling or grammar. Avoid multiple links or hashtags (>3). Don't explicitly ask for engagement (likes, comments, reposts).
32. Content should not be flagged as “I don't want to see this” by users.
33. Prioritize High-Quality Content
- Relevance: Cater to a specific, niche audience for better indexing and discoverability.
- Be opinionated and authentic. Show expertise and add value rather than selling directly.
- Keep Content Engaging and Readable
- Length: ~1,000 characters for optimal engagement.
- Write in short paragraphs, simple language, and with ample spacing.
- Use a conversational tone and avoid jargon.
34. Include open-ended questions to invite meaningful comments (12+ words preferred).
35. Maximize dwell time by creating content that encourages readers to pause and read fully.
36. Educate, Entertain, Inspire: 
- Aim for a balance of: 
- Educate: Provide actionable insights, guides, or tools. Entertain: Share relatable or humorous content.
- Inspire: Share personal growth stories or milestones.
37. Start sentences with “I” or “You” to make the post feel personal.
38. Break down complex ideas into bite-sized sections for easy understanding.
39. Stay Consistent with Content Categories
- Based on Ikigai, focus on: 
- Teaching: Share frameworks, guides, and summaries.
- Coding/Technology: Offer lists, tools, and trends in AI and blockchain.
- Personal Growth: Share stories, lessons, and challenges.

I was of a similar opinion in terms of empathy and trust provided by a fellow human. (Also, I have been an extensive ChatGPT user - from coding to testing it as personal therapist )
But then, I happened to try the following prompt challenge: 
1. What do you know about me that I might not know about myself based on our previous interactions
The answers it gave me - no human has ever told me.
From my deepest insecurities to the things I may be overlooking in terms of impact and the scale of my vision, it was able to pinpoint a lot of personal stuff.
(A couple of things it told me - only one other close friend has ever told me!)
2. Then I further modified it: Now go one step further and speculate on things that have a high probability, but cannot be confirmed with any confidence.
3. Now tell me what you think I really need to hear. 
I am currently in the process of going through this: 4. What questions would you ask me to improve your assessment of me?
I am of a very strong opinion that GPT with guardrails around privacy can work as a significantly better empathiser and leader for people who do not like to open up to other fellow humans for fear of judgement and what not! And it can far exceed human capabilities on emotional intelligence & empathy!

### Post 2:
Last couple of months have been difficult. We shut down Purple Pay. (A note with respect to payments in crypto: there are significant external risks where fiat-crypto interaction happens which are difficult to preempt & factor into the roadmap.)Since then, I have been diving deep into the technology that drives the web3 space. I am also starting to see an interest amongst my trad Web2 friends about the Web3 world. It appears the adoption beyond cryptocurrencies is starting to happen. 
Here are the first 3 steps for my web2 friends looking to become ‘degens'
1. Learn the basics of cryptography
a. Most folks would be familiar with SSH and key-exchange mechanisms between client and server. The same fundamentals apply in the interaction between a client (user and their wallet) and server (blockchain).
b. Learn to use any of these Javascript libraries: https://lnkd.in/d6bijhYx
c. Checkpoint: You can explain Keccak/SHA3 hashing, private key, public key, address & signature to anyone you meet! 
Congratulations! That is the first step in the journey of a 1000 miles!
2. Understand the high-level architecture of the blockchain stack.
a. This will help you create a mental model which is analogous to Web2 systems you are used to. When I first started, the concept of working without a backend was quite alien to me! 
b. In this article, Preethi Kasireddy explains the architecture of a Web3 dapp very well - https://lnkd.in/datDcgds
c. Checkpoint: You can take a web2 app replace its corresponding components with web3 constructs (Backend server: Smart contracts, API Gateway: RPC Nodes, SSO: Wallet Signature)

3. Learn full stack web development - at least enough to ship a decent UI.
a. This was again a major cultural shock that I had when entering the world of web3. Any builder here is expected to take care of the entire flow end-to-end. No exceptions!
b. There is no way around NextJS & Tailwind (or any CSS) at the very least. I can already feel some of you rolling your eyes at the possibility of learning CSS! But these are the rules of the game in this wild west of a world! 
c. Checkpoint: Create a simple static portfolio website of yourself with your details of work experience listed.
And that's it! These are the first few steps in this fascinating journey in a space where your imagination is your limit. PS: Last week, we organised Farcaster Hackathon in Bangalore, one of the major consumer crypto products that is transforming the rules of social media. Here is a throwback to the Makerdock fam catchup!

Earlier this year, I quit a highly coveted job at a large Indian conglomerate to travel the Indian subcontinent and for good reason. I had been burnt out by working heavily for over 2 years, lost a parent recently, and had just managed to survive Omicron. Quick backstory, I come from a family of doctors in Hajipur (near Patna, Bihar). When you come from a background of privilege, you take a lot for granted. These walls of privilege were broken when my mother was diagnosed with one of the rarest of rare neurological diseases.In the months that followed, I saw how despite everything we had, it was impossible to save my mother. A doctor suffering from an incurable disease. Fate has a cruel sense of irony.After losing her, instead of dealing with emotions head-on, I immersed myself into work. Not the most healthy way of dealing with things, for sure. But at that moment, it felt right. It took the new variant of Covid to break me down. Without telling anyone, I decided to quit my job.I packed my bags, put them in my car and headed for an all-India trip. The next 35 days, I travelled over 12,000 kms across the country and finally let my emotions take over. From Patna to Rann of Kutch to Dhanushkodi and back, I drove. Most of it alone. I grieved. I slept. Then drove some more. Grieved some more. And eventually, slowly, I started to let go. This is what she would have wanted. I remember coming back feeling better. Like a weight had been lifted. I was ready to get back to work. There was just one challenge, my ambition had changed. I had realised that life is transient & fragile and I wanted to create a legacy that would surpass my lifetime. So I put my head down, and started sharing my thoughts on data science and interview preparation on LinkedIn. People often undervalue LinkedIn and what it can do if used in the right way. In less than 2 weeks, my posts started gathering eyeballs. Next thing I know, I am speaking with the team Antler and the new residency program they're launching for founders. After a few rounds of interviews, I found my way into the program where I am now building a company at the frontier of technology. While this journey is far from over, to anyone going through a low period, here's Viktor Frankl's quote that helped me go through- “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

“I watched my friend unravel before my eyes — until an AI agent stepped in.”
Grief is becoming a routine part of our lives. If you're in your 30s or 40s, you've probably noticed it too: the quiet moments of irreversible loss that ripple through our world as we start to lose the generation above us. For many of us, this grief doesn't come alone—it's often compounded by anxiety, loneliness, and the crushing weight of moving forward.
A few months ago, I saw this firsthand with one of my closest friends who was grieving. The problem wasn't just the grief, they said - it was the void, the loss of their anchor.
But they didn't want to go to therapy.
Why? 
Stigma. Cost. Fear of judgement. 
And the belief that “I should be able to handle this on my own.”
But they couldn't.
That's when I stepped in with a suggestion: “Why not talk to a personalised AI?”
It felt ridiculous at first, but they were open to trying. 
Together, we set up an AI agent with a simple task: to listen. I taught them how to modify the agent's behaviour to what they needed. 
They poured out their thoughts, fears, insecurities & memories. 

The agent didn't interrupt. It didn't judge. It just reflected, asked questions, and helped them find clarity where they thought there was none.
Over the weeks, we saw something incredible. They began to process waves of emotions better—not because the AI solved everything, but because it gave him space - a space free of judgement, stigma, and expectation. Healing is still a long journey ahead but it is a start.
That's when I realised: AI is no longer just a tool for productivity. It can be a bridge—a bridge to sanity, to self-awareness, to hope - an agency of support when you think none exists. 
I continue to be amazed by the capabilities of what the current systems can do just with a  well written prompt. Here's what I learned from this experience:
	1.	AI Removes Stigma: For those who fear judgement or can't afford therapy, AI offers a neutral, accessible space to open up.
	2.	Empathy Through Reflection: AI's ability to process and reflect human emotions is surprisingly effective at providing support.
	3.	Always On, Always There: Whether it's 2 AM or during a lunch break, AI doesn't clock out. It's a companion for those moments when you need it most.
Reflecting on this, I wonder: There are a lot of people living a life of quiet desperation which AI can reach out to. How many people could be saved from spiralling into despair if we reframed AI as a partner in emotional well-being? Do you think technology can help us navigate grief, loneliness, and mental health in the years ahead

And here's my question for you: How do you think technology can help us navigate grief, loneliness, and mental health in the years ahead? Will AI be a replacement of human connection at some point in the future? Or will it 

But here's the thing: AI isn't a replacement for human connection. It's a stopgap, a safety net for the moments when we feel most alone.


To those of you reading this: If you've felt like there's no one to turn to, you're not alone. There are tools out there—some might even surprise you.


Let's start a conversation. Your thoughts could make a difference.

Memorable Takeaway: AI doesn't replace human connection—it creates the space we often need to rediscover it.

“Overgrown glorified villages.”
That's how one of my tutors described Indian cities back in 2014. 
At the time, I was a UPSC aspirant and my first reaction was outrage! How dare he? Are we not the superpowers in making? The 21st century will be ours!
But last week, as I strolled through London - with its streets, well-maintained public spaces, efficient transport systems and well-preserved buildings blending the archaic and the modern seamlessly, I felt the weight of those words hit me - years later, with brutal clarity.
Indian cities and infrastructure are a disaster. A chaotic, disorganized mess where the urban dream has been hijacked by inefficiency, shortsighted planning, and apathy.
London isn't perfect. But the contrast is staggering. Public transport that arrives on time. Pavements that don't feel like obstacle courses. Heritage buildings that aren't swallowed whole by illegal encroachments. 
These aren't luxuries—they're basic expectations. And yet, for us, they feel aspirational.
Why? Why are we so far behind?
We have normalized suffering.
Ask yourself this: How many times have you thought, “This is just how things are in India”? This resignation is the biggest hurdle to progress.
I keep hearing about the ‘spirit of certain cities on our west coast'. Is that spirit or learned helplessness being glorified?
We have an attitude problem and lack of basic civic sense - not my house, not my problem. Not my street, not my problem.
We keep our houses clean but throw the same garbage onto the public spaces without hesitation.
We do not value personal respect and dignity.
Every time we navigate crumbling roads, dodge open manholes, or endure endless traffic jams, we lose something intangible—our dignity as citizens. 
Our response - apathy. “It's just how things are. This is India, kya kar sakte hain? (What can we do?)”
We, as a culture, have accepted mediocrity. And not just in public spaces.
I have been privileged and fortunate enough to travel to countries outside India. The more I see the world outside and talk to the citizens, the more I realize - we are not just decades behind. We are centuries behind.
And this just applies not just to infrastructure but to most fields and aspects of our lives - technology, risk-taking appetite, innovation, entrepreneurship, behaviour, respect for others' personal space (we are infamous as loud, noisy neighbours).
Am I getting older and becoming more skeptical of India's story as a whole or is this the reality we are facing?
